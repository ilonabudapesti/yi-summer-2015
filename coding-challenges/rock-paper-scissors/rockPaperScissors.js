/*
* Imagine we are playing a three-round game of  rock, paper, scissors.
* Write a function that outputs all possible combinations 
* that one player could play.
*
* Your output should look something like:
*   [["rock", "rock", "rock"],
*    ["rock", "rock", "paper"],
*    ["rock", "rock", "scissors"],
*    ["rock", "paper", "rock"],
             ...etc...
     ]
*
* Extra credit:
*   - Make your function return answers for any number of rounds.
*   
* Example:
* rockPaperScissors(5); // => [['rock', 'rock', 'rock', 'rock', 'rock'], etc...]
*
* Extra extra credit:
*   - Write a test suite with mocha, add specs and a spec runner to test your function.
