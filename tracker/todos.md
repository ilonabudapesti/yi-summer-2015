# TODO

- organization of files: if you are going to separate into /js and /css it is good idea to also separate /lib or /vendor for outside libraries and tools
- separation of concerns: no HTML in JS files and vice versa
- DRY principle = Don't Repeat Yourself. As developers we want to be la-zy. Not just ordinarily lazy, but proactively, agressively lazy. Anytime a similar operation is performed it is better to abstract away the common factors and reuse code. Your code is very repetitive and abstracting away will also help loosen the coupling.
