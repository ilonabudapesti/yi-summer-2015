## quotes

"Node stems primarily from trying to solve the file upload progress-bar problem" (uploading files via http was not possible before 2005, mind you) 
"They say asynchronous code is hard to write. We are not addressing that. Our problem is: writing network servers easily."
- by Ryan Dahl creator of Node.js
